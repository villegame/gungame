1. Moving with keyboard (wsad) OR with form buttons (not so good option)
2. Gun loading cooldown before shooting again
3. Unique player names & chatbox (requires identification messages with server, server keeps list of players in game)
4. Show approximate area of shot origin in map (not own shots, require unique player names in shots, no need to show own shots on map anymore)
5. Hitpoints
6. Widen the area of shot effect with for example 9 squares of which center is 100% hit and others 50% hits (requires hitpoints).
7. Wind effect on shots (?)
